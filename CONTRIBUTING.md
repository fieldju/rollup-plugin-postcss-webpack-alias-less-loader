# Contributing

Pull requests are welcome, please keep conversations and commit messages civil.

1. Fork, then clone the repo.

1. Set up your machine.

    ```bash
    yarn
    ```

1. Make sure the tests pass.
    
    ```bash
    yarn test
    ```

1. Make your change. Add tests for your change. Make the linter and tests pass.

    1. Document changes using the [jsdoc standards](http://usejsdoc.org/) to ensure that our code self-generates good documentation.
    
        build the jsdoc site, the files will be outputted to `./build/docs/`
        
        ```bash
        yarn generate-docs
        ```
        
        Validate that your generated documentation is what you intended, as documentation gets autogenerated from master.
    
    1. Run prettier to format code to comply with code style (Modified AirBnB Rule set: [ES Lint Config](.eslintrc.json))

        ```bash
        yarn format
        ```

    1. Make sure sure the linter and unit tests pass and the docs can be generated.

        ```bash
        yarn test
        ```

1. Push to your fork and submit a pull request and wait for peer review.

    We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
    
    Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:
    
    1. Your code must be documented inline via jsdoc annotations, tested, and pass the linter.
    1. Your changes must not break the existing library API without good justification.
    1. Your commit messages should be reasonable. (`git rebase -i head~n` choose the r option to reword you commits).
